	    <h3>Peanut Butter (two or three years old)</h3>

	    <p id="body">
	   
		It was a spring day and my dad was working on the yard in the retirement trailer park where we lived. I had already eaten breakfast and it was nearing on lunch time. I was hungry. I went outside and starting fallowing my dad, he ignored me at first but I kept tailing him. He finally turned to me and asked what I wanted. I told him I wanted some peanut butter. He told me that I had to wait until lunch and to go inside.<br><br>
		Now young Sam was very industrious and did not like to be told no, or to wait. So I took the two steps in to our fifth wheel and began to think. Previously I had gotten in trouble for climbing the cabinets to get what I wanted. I knew the peanut butter was kept on the very top shelf out of my reach, so I grabbed a chair/stool and dragged it over to the pantry. I climbed up and reached but it was still to high. So I went and grabbed a box and put it in the chair and was just able to reach the peanut butter. With my prize in hand I climbed back down and put the peanut butter on the ground.<br><br>
		Realizing if I left the chair and box there I would get caught I cleaned up all signs of my ingenuity. I decided that incase I get caught, I should protect my bottom from being spanked. I grabbed every pair of underwear I owned and put them on then I found a news paper and stuffed it down my shorts as well. Finally it was time to eat my prize. I opened up the lid and stuck my whole hand in to scoop out large globs of peanut butter. As I sat and ate, I got peanut butter everywhere.<br><br>
		My dad walked in, after one glance he was pissed. He scolded me, grabbed the peanut butter and told me how I ruined the whole jar. He grayed a towel and started cleaning up the peanut butter from all the surfaces I had touched. Once done he told me to get up and to come over to him so he could give me a spankin'. I had to move very carefully, trying not to dislodge the newspaper before I it would serve itâ€™s purpose. 
		My dad grabbed the newspaper out of my shorts and tossed it on the table. He looked down and saw how plump my shorts still were and had to hold back a laugh. He told me to stand up. He asked me what else I had stuffed down my shorts, I of course said there was nothing stuffed down my shorts. He then realized that I was wearing many layers of clothing and underwear.<br><br>
		My dad had a very serious face, I found out later this was to keep from laughing. He had me go to my room and take off all the extra clothes and to stay there until he called me back out. I stayed as quite as possible hoping he would forget what happened. He never did give me that spanking.<br><br>
 		This story was rebuilt from my vague memory and my father recounting the story to me later.<br><br>

	    <h3>Misadventures of a first grader.</h3>

	    <p id="body">
   			It was dental hygiene day at school. That morning I woke up early, brushed my teeth extra well and off I went. I wouldn't eat breakfast, I was getting a tooth care prize. This day I was prepared, as a determined 6 year old could be. My elementary school did a dental hygiene day every week. I had never managed to get a prize, my teacher Mrs. B always deemed my mouth not worthy. <br><br>
   			Finally the starting chime for school played over the playgrounds speakers and my class lined up at the door to go in. I was so excited I could barely contain myself, the moment I saw my teacher I burst out  "Mrs. B come look at my teeth I'm ready!", to which she responded "Be quiet and get in line, it seems you will be starting the day out with a yellow flag." Utterly deflated I got back in line and filed through the doors with the rest of the class. When we got to our room we each found a little cup with sweet smelling pink fluid inside. <br><br>
    		Mrs. B called our attention to the front of the class and told us we would be learning how to use mouthwash today and asked for a volunteer. At first no one raised their hands, but a urge welled up inside of me and I jumped to my feet and called out "this is how it's done". I promptly raised the little cup with pink fluid to my lips and filled my mouth all the way up. I imagine I must have looked like a chipmunk for there was no more room left inside of my mouth. My teacher at this point had made her way over to my desk trying to roll with my impulsive act and asked me to swish the liquid around. I looked up at my stern teachers face and tried to swish as she said. As she looked down at me, a moment of alarm cross her face as she realized how full my mouth really was. She started to tell me to spit some of the fluid back in to the cup, but it was to late. I started to swish and a spray of pink bubblegum smelling mouthwash came streaming from my mouth and hit my teacher starting at the neck and down to the waist.<br><br> 
    		Then the urge to laugh hit me, I couldn't stop. The supply of mouthwash seemed to be endless as the giggles hit me. I deposited the rest of the spraying fluids upon all my classmates. Mrs. B was not amused, but even though the laughing was getting me in trouble I couldn't stop. Not knowing what else to do Mrs. B called the nurse to take me away to the office and I spent the rest of the day in the detention room.<br><br>
